About PushpinWeb
================

The PushpinWeb API connects developers and data analysts with government
data.  Learn more about PushpinWeb and the rich datasets you can discover
behind the API at [http://www.pushpinweb.com][0].

PushpinWeb's API is a [RESTful][1] [JSON][2] API. [HTTP Digest][3] is
used for authentication, and queries are centered on a geographic point
with and address, intersection, or latitude and longitude. Currently,
queries are limited to the New York City metropolitan area. If your app
needs a dataset not found on PushpinWeb you can send feedback and request it.

Questions and feedback about Pushpinweb are always welcome! [pushpinweb@gmail.com][4]

PushpinWeb Client Examples
==========================

This API should be as straight forward and simple as possible.  To help new
users get the most from this API, we've published this collection of API
client examples in a variety of languages.  Each example queries the API
for the details on the dataset with an id of 1, the restaurant health
inspection data.  Please contribute back your own API clients!

Given the correct libraries being installed, each of these examples can be
run from the command-line.  For example, run this command to try the Ruby
[Curb][5] library:

    PPW_USER=YOUR_USER PPW_PASS=YOUR_PASSWORD ruby/ppw-curb.rb

You will need to [sign up for PushpinWeb][6]
and get an API account before trying any examples.  You can
